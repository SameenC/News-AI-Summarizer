# News AI Summarizer

This project is a command-line interface (CLI) application that fetches news articles based on user-defined keywords and provides AI-generated summaries using the BART model. The application uses NewsAPI for fetching news articles and a Python-based pipeline for scraping and summarizing the content.

## Features

-   Fetches news articles based on user-input keywords.
-   Allows users to specify the number of articles to retrieve.
-   Summarizes the content of each article using the BART model.
-   Simple CLI interface for easy interaction.

## Prerequisites

-   Python 3
-   An active NewsAPI key (Free sign up at [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/))
-   Required Python libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install requests beautifulsoup4 transformers
    ```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the project files.
2. Navigate to the project directory and install the required libraries:
    - requests, beautifulsoup4, transformers

## Usage

1. Run the script using the command:
    ```bash
    python news.py
    ```
2. Follow the prompts in the terminal:
    - **Enter keywords**: Provide the keywords you want the news articles to be based on (comma-separated).
    - **Specify the number of articles**: Indicate how many articles you want to fetch and summarize.
3. The program will fetch the articles, scrape the full content, summarize it, and display the summarized news along with the title and a brief description.

## Known Issues

-   Some unwanted details may be generated by the AI model since it is in terminal.
-   The program currently runs in a CLI environment, which may not be ideal for non-technical users.

## Future Improvements

-   Implement a web interface using React for a more user-friendly experience.
-   Integrate more advanced paid summarization models that can handle longer text inputs directly.
